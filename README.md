**About me**

- 💼 AI & Python Developer Intern – Risk Analytics at [**BMW Group**](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html)

- 🌍 Currently on exchange at Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Munich, Germany

- 📚 Mechanical Engineering student at [**Federal University of Santa Catarina**](https://ufsc.br/)

- 🏢 2+ years of experience as AI Engineer Intern at Fundação CERTI, working on AI, data, and industrial software projects for large companies

- 🌱 I'm passionate about data and programming, and I'm always open to learning new languages and meeting new people. I have a professional interest in Agentic AI and am an enthusiast of mathematics, physics, and advanced topics in machine learning.

**Experience**

- 🤖 Developed an algorithm for WEG S.A. (Wind Turbines) to generate predictive alarms and minimize unscheduled maintenance which led to a significant reduction in maintenance costs.

- 📲 Created a new app for WEG S.A. to interface with an accelerometer sensor in a vibration control system. The project involved leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), as well as applying concepts of vibration control and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

- 🧩 Implemented a statistical and clustering algorithm for electronic devices in a MESH network for Landis+Gyr, mapping devices with the highest instability. Additionally, developed a tool to open and visualize the network topology, reducing generation time by over 99% (from 5 minutes to just 2 seconds). These improvements decreased manual analysis efforts and significantly accelerated operational evaluation by the monitoring team.

- 🔧 Developed an automated Python system for Docol to monitor and analyze metallic commodity prices, identifying optimal purchasing moments through historical and graphical analysis. Integrated with Power BI via Google Sheets and deployed with Docker and Linux cronjobs. The solution outperformed traditional methods across seven different metallic commodities, achieving positive returns in all cases.

- ☢️ Led an Industry 4.0 project aimed at automating data acquisition and monitoring from an industrial tomograph. The primary objectives included: (i) establishing a data pipeline for acquisition; (ii) creating scripts for data ingestion and processing; (iii) developing a backend with REST API solutions; (iv) structuring a frontend website for real-time monitoring; (v) deploying Docker containers on the Fundação CERTI system.
